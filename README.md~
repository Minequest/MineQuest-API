**What is MineQuest?**
MineQuest is a full featured MMORPG system. It allows custom quests, classes, and more!

**What makes this different than other quest plugins?** It includes leveling capabilities, SpoutPlugin support, and the ability to create instanced dungeons.

    This is MineQuest, version 3. It is platform-independent.
    For the most recent non-platform independent API release, see the `2` branch for MineQuest 2.0.0.
